# oo-neural-net
An object-oriented neural network implementation in Python.

To meet the requirements of an assignment, as well as improve my own understanding, I've developed this simple object-oriented example
of a neural network in Python. It was my goal to leverage encapsulation by creating distinct classes for the Network, Layers,
Perceptron, and Activation Functions.

For now, the three network-related classes share similar structures, though none are actually children of the other classes. The
inheritance structure may change in the future.

As demonstrated in test.py, this neural network is capable of taking a user-defined shape (all fully-connected layers), with user-
defined weights and bias.
